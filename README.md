# AOD-level-variation-during-COVID-19-lockdowns
This python code was used to analyze the variation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in 13 selected cities
in Eurasia during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown periods, using 10 years of AOD data retrieved from the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard the NASA satellites Terra and Aqua, 
using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm (collection 6.1). Please 
note due to the space limitation, the original satellite data has not been uploaded, only the 10-year time 
series AOD data over selected cities is presented. 

Thirteen cities from three different regions (Europe, China, and India) were selected in this study, 
including Elche and Madrid in Spain, Milan and Rome in Italy, New Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, and Raipur 
in India, and Beijing, Lanzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Chengdu in China.  

To run this code, the following Python packages are required:
numpy, pyhdf.SD, matplotlib, scipy
This code has been tested in python 3.6.7.
